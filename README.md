I wanted to view this video for help with the Async part of the testing and hearing further explanation using Jasmine for testing.  I originally found a more complex way to test the menu using *spies* which focus on the click event.  I changed it after watching this tutorial because I like the simpler more direct method of testing the class. I included the links for the articles on *spies* after this because they did influence my understanding of Jamsine and testing.

- stack overflow solution that referenced HTMLGoodies article above, explained how to handle DOM elements in Jasime [here]("https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48872864/testing-for-click-event-with-jasmine")
